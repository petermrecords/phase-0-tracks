# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is tracking the revision history of a group of files so that it can be used to merge revisions from several users.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

Branching allows a user to make and save changes separately from the main code base.  This ensures that the main code base is not damaged as you work and allows users to make changes simultaneously without conflicts.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point in git.  Changes to all files that have been staged (using 'git add') are stored.  A good commit message contains meaningful information about the changes that have been made.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when two users make changes to the same line(s) of code.
