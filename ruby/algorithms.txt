MAKING COFFEE WITH AN ESPRESSO MAKER

Consider the espresso maker - a bottom section, a coffee plug with a lid, and a top section also with a lid.

Consider also, the coffee grounds, the stove and the coffee cup.

Fill the bottom section of the espresso maker with cold water, 3/4 of the way.

Fill the coffee plug with coffee grounds, half way, and cover it with its lid.

Fit the coffee plug into the bottom section, and screw on the top section.

Cover the top section with its lid.

Place the espresso maker on the stove and turn the burner on to HIGH.

Wait for the coffee to boil (you will be able to hear it!)

Remove the espresso maker from the stove (don't burn yourself) and turn off the burner.

Pour the coffee in to the coffee cup, and let it cool for 10 minutes.
