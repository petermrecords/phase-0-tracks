# PLAN TO STUDY

## BEFORE PAIR THING (in an hour):

Find and bookmark the documentation for jquery
Read it a little bit

## AFTER PAIR THING

Take a break

Do the codeacademy course for jquery

Take a break before doing the project part of it - think of ideas etc but do something else

# POST STUDY NOTES

I think doing the entire code academy course in one shot was a little too much without a break.  I finished it OK but I was getting a little burnt out by the end and don't think I got as much out of the later modules.

Reading the documentation a bit first was very helpful, the summaries etc gave me an idea of what to expect later without having to go into too much depth.
